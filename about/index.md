# About NYC / ADV

New York City Adventure Cycling Club, NYC/ADV, is a group of like-minded individuals passionate about bicycles, traveling, and the outdoors. These passions coverage into adventures by bike. Our group organizes events through our [Meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/NYC-Adventure-Cycling-Club/) that include group rides, overnight trips, classes, socials, etc. 



## Who can join
Any and all are welcome to join and attend! 

Our rides range from **difficult** to **very difficult**. **Difficult**, *for those who are novice or are starting out* and **very difficult**, *for those who really like a challenge*. Traveling by bike is a physical activity and can be inherently difficult at times. Don't let this dissuade you. We try our best to offer a range of rides and routes suitable for those who are starting out to those with who want to do a little bit more. Bicycle touring isn't racing. It's not about the speed or distance, it is about enjoying the journey. 

Our organization is a group of people and our event organizers are not guides. As such they reserve the right to deny any person from participating in a ride for any safety reason (see disclaimer below). We would love to have you along, but we want to make sure everyone has a safe and enjoyable time Our social mixer is every third Thursday of the month and is a perfect place to meet our members and ask questions. Check out our [Meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/NYC-Adventure-Cycling-Club/) to find out when our next social is.   



## Disclaimer 

By participating in any of our events you agree to “bear all risks” and release the organizers and event hosts from claims, demands, and damages arising out of your use of the platform. Group organizers are not guides. Bicycling on public roads contains risk. Attendees understand and intend that this assumption of risk and release is binding upon their heirs, executors, and guests who are not active members of the New York Adventure Cycling Club Meetup group. Long story short, if you choose to join for rides, organizers are not responsible for participants health, safety, and/or well being.
