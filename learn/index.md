# Get on your bike and go

Thats the whole point of touring. Its the mantra you'll be telling yourself time and again when you are out on a tour. It might when your are tired and facing a grueling climb to camp. When you its rainy or cold out and all you want to do is stay in your sleeping bag. And more likely than not its what you'll have to tell yourself even before your step out your door. Adventures are meant to be exciting, unknown, and challenging. 

## People
(Dif between touring and expeditions) You need to be nice.



## The bike



You can use about any bike at your disposal to tour on. If it has two wheels and you can pedal––then it can take you places. Some limit the terrain you are able to travel on, but the real limit is how to carry your necessities and all the other stuff you are bound to bring with you. Go here to learn [How to carry S#*T](/learn/carry). 

It's a myth that you need a "touring" bike to tour on. Bikes come in all diffrent styles designed for different purposes. Its just really nice to have a bike designed to travel long distances, with lots of weight, for a really long time. You'll have a much easier and enjoyable time.


The list will go from the most abundant and generic bikes to the most specific built 


### Old Road bikes
They are everywhere. You can pick them up for a dime. You may think they would be completely unsuitable for touring on, but take a look at these photos:

Just look at those shorts! Nerds. These cool cats traveled all the way across America for [Bikecentennial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bikecentennial) way back in 76. They did this very likely before you were born and on bikes that you take for granted. Don't complain about having the right touring gear ever again. They did it on your basic road bike of the 70's "Sports Touring". They attached a rear rack, threw some bags and panniers on the back and hung a handlebar bag in front. Do the same and you'll be good for thousands of miles. Plus you get the benefit of 40+ years of technology improvements of waterproof gear and flat resistant tires.

Road bikes are not made for single track and fat tire mountain bikes are the Hummers of the cycling world. They looking awesome out in nature, but you'll look like a compensating douche on the open road.
