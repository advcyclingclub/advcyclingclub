# Get on your bike and go

Thats the whole point of touring. Its the mantra you'll be telling yourself time and again when you are out on a tour. It might when your are tired and facing a grueling climb to camp. When you its rainy or cold out and all you want to do is stay in your sleeping bag. And more likely than not its what you'll have to tell yourself even before your step out your door. Adventures are meant to be exciting, unknown, and challenging. 

## People
(Dif between touring and expeditions) You need to be nice.



## The bike
Use whatever you have at your disposal, if it has two wheels and you can pedal––then it can take you places. Use common sense though please. Road bikes are not made for single track and fat tire mountain bikes are the Hummers of the cycling world. They looking awesome out in nature, but you'll look like a compensating douche on the open road. 

You can use about any bike to tour on not because something is special about the bike, but because its all about HOW you carry stuff. As for WHAT to carry, recommendations are below.


## How to carry S#*T

In the beginning Man made the wheel. Then Man made bikes. Right away Man started slapping bags onto bikes. This was less then ideal. Then Man made racks. Man started putting all sorts of stuff on racks. This was good and nothing much else happened. Then Man one day was in the shower and remembered Velcro, buckles, and straps (some of his previous inventions) and had a great idea to put them all together. Thus Man Made Bags Great Again™ and started slapping them onto bikes again. Thus Man reinvented the wheel.

And thats why we have so many wonderful options to carry stuff on our bikes. Yes pockets, backpacks, and even fanny packs exist, but for the sake of this topic they don't exist. To start we'll talk about the back of the bike, because everybuddy appreciates a good rear.
